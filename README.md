Immaga api integration for captioning and face detection

The Imagga API is a set of image understanding and analysis technologies available as a web service that allows you to automate the process of analyzing, organizing and searching through large collections of unstructured images. Imagga allows you to autotag images, categorize, crop, detect a face and other tools for image analysing.

The project has two parts. In the first part we connect to api and get first 12 generated tags of the given image and display them. Also we generate word cloud from first 20 generated tags.
In the second part we get details about face detection of the given image and display it along with other information such as age, gender, etc., also getting coordinates of face and displaying image with green bounding box.

Project is implemented in Google Colaboratory space.
